# DarwinbotsC++

This is more or less a straight port of Darwinbots2 from VB6 to C++. Work on it was mostly finished
(feature complete for the most part, but really buggy). It was abandoned after realizing that it
had inherited lots of the problems from the VB source, so the port wasn't really worth the effort.
