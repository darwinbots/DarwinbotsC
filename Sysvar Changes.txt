*.setaim is now set to what *.aim reads as default.  By changing this value, your bot will attempt to turn in that direction, overriding .aimdx and .aimsx.

.aimdx and .aimsx now have clone commands .aimright and .aimleft.  .aimleft and .aimright point to the same memory locations .aimdx and .aimsx do, the commands and entirely interchangable.

.paralyzed - The memory location was already being used for this, but no sysvar existed to tell people that!  Returns the number of cycles left until the effects of venom run out.  0 means not venomized.

.mkpoison and .mkvenom - same as .aimright and .aimleft, just another way to access .strvenom and .strpoison that follows the same pattern as .mkvirus, .mkshell, .mkslime, etc.

Everytime you use nrg, you gain 1/10th of what you spent back as waste.  The exception to this is poison and venom, which gives you back ~ 1/7th of what you spent.  This is a double edged sword, since if you give your extra waste to a veg, it'll give you nrg, but you'll also accumulate pwaste faster (pwaste increases whenever you try to rid yourself of waste, but not when someone takes waste from you).  -- I may change this so that a percentage of waste in a bot every cycle sticks as pwaste.

*.mass now reads back your mass * 100 for finer mass readings

*.sun now gives you the intensity of the sun for your eye

*.hitang now gives you the angle you were hit at

discontinued:
hitup, hitdn, hitsx, hitdx
shup, shdn, shdx, shsx

*.hit now returns the momentum of the bot that hit you (mass * relative velocity)

xpos and ypos now give you values that are / 120 of what they were before

DNA changes:

~=, !~=, %= and !%= have been discontinued.  The functionality can be provided using sub and abs without the need for complication these induce.

shots are now modded by 1000 for positive values and 10 for negative values, so bots are much more likely to stumble upon values that work for these two.
