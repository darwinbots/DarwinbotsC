I have included my project files as a courtesy.  I won't always be updating it, as I keep my project file in a seperate place.  However, it should help get you started.  Be sure that it's including all the source code files if you get a compile error.

Expected Hierarchy:

Some Folder:
--Darwinbots (folder containing source)
--Workspace (folder containing workspace (ie: this folder))
